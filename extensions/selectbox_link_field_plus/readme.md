# SelectBox Link Field Plus

## What does this extension do?

This extension extends the functionality of the
[Selectbox Link Field](https://github.com/symphonycms/selectbox_link_field)-extension.

The extended functionality is:

 - It adds a button to the selectbox link field to create a new entry on-the-fly.
 - It provides the possibility to use different views, depending on what you are using it for (see 'View').

## Requirements

This extension requires that you have the
[Selectbox Link Field](https://github.com/symphonycms/selectbox_link_field)-extension in your extension folder,
since it extends those classes. Just having the directory in your extensions-folder is enough, you don't have to
enable it.

## Different views

Different situations require different views. For example, if you want to connect entries from a news-section or a
blog-section, you want to display them differently than if you would use it for an image gallery. See the different
views in the views-folder for how views are handled and how you can create your own views.
