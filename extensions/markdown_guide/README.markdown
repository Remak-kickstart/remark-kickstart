Markdown Guide Extension
=======================

* Version: 1.3
* Author: Carson Sasser (sassercw@cox.net)
* Build Date: 28 September 2010
* Requirements: Tested on Symphony CMS versions 2.0.6, 2.0.7 and 2.1.1. Requires version 1.11 of the Markdown Text Formatter extension.

Installation
------------

1. Install the files and assets directory in a folder named 'markdown_guide' inside your Symphony 'extensions' folder.

2. Enable it by selecting `Markdown Guide` in the `System -> Extensions` menu, choose Enable from the with-selected menu, and then click Apply.

3. Now a button for showing the condensed guide will appear below any textarea field that uses one of the markdown text formatter options.

TODO
----

* Add additional styling when I figure out why the styling interferes with the operation of the show-hide toggle.
