[Origin]

This extension is a variation of the 'Unique Upload Field' extension by
Michael Eichelsdoerfer and the "reflection field" by Rowan Lewis.

[Installation]

1. Upload the 'reflecteduploadfield' folder in this archive to your Symphony
   'extensions' folder.

2. Enable it by selecting the "Field: Reflected File Upload", choose Enable from
   the with-selected menu, then click Apply.

3. You can now add the "Reflected File Upload" field to your sections.

[Using]

This field enables you to specify the naming expression using XPath (like in the reflection field). When uniqueness is important you can enable the "Always create unique name" option. This will add "Unique Upload Field" behavior by appending a unique token to the filename.
