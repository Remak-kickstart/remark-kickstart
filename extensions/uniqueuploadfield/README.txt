# Field: Unique File Upload

This extension, just like the Hashed Upload Field extension by Rowan Lewis, provides an upload field which allows multiple copies of a file to be uploaded to the same location. It will retain the filename and append a unique ID to it.

The extension uses PHPâ€™s preg_replace function and will crop the filename (i.e. w/o file extension) to a fixed length.

## Origin

This extension is a variation of the 'Hashed Upload Field' extension by Rowan Lewis.

## Installation

1. Upload the 'uniqueuploadfield' folder in this archive to your Symphony 'extensions' folder.

2. Enable it by selecting the "Field: Unique File Upload", choose Enable from the with-selected menu, then click Apply.

3. You can now add the "Unique File Upload" field to your sections.

## Updating

There is no special update procedure for this extension if you are using (or updating to) Symphony > 2.0.6.

(There has been a manual update procedure for all upload fields in earlier Symphony versions which has been moved to the Symphony updater script.)
